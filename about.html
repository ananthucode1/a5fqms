                  <h2>About</h2>
                  <p id="aboutp">Food plays a central role in human societies and is essential to the well-being of people
                    and the planet. The food and agriculture sector is the single largest employer in the world,
                    despite a majority of its workers living in poverty. Nearly one-third of global food production
                    is wasted, yet up to 800 million people are undernourished. In addition, food systems are
                    responsible for 25 percentage of global greenhouse-gas emissions, About 600 million people
                    suffer food poisoning every year, according to the World Health Organization, and 420,000 die
                    as a result.
                    The evolution of multipurpose sensors over the last decades has been investigated with
                    the aim of developing innovative devices with applications in several fields of technology, including in the food industry. The integration of such sensors in food packaging technology has
                    paved the way for intelligent food packaging. These integrated systems are capable of providing reliable information about the quality of the packed products during their storage period.
                    To accomplish this goal, intelligent packs use a variety of sensors suited for monitoring the
                    quality and safety of food products by recording the evolution of parameters like the quantity
                    of pathogen agents, gases, temperature, humidity and storage period. This technology, when
                    combined with IOT, is able to provide a lot more information than conventional food inspection
                    technologies, which are limited to weight, volume, colour and aspect inspection. The original
                    system described in this work relies on a simple but effective method of integrated food monitoring, right at the client home, suitable for user prepared vacuum-packed foods. It builds upon
                    the IOT concept and is able to create a network of interconnected devices</p>
